Problem Statement:
 Let torque be denoted by 𝜏 = [𝜏𝑥 𝜏𝑦 𝜏𝑧] where 𝜏𝑥, 𝜏𝑦, and 𝜏𝑧 are
the component of the torque along the x, y, and z body axis of the satellite respectively

Let the magnetic moment be 𝑚 = [𝑚𝑥 𝑚𝑦 𝑚𝑧] where 𝑚𝑥, 𝑚𝑦, and 𝑚𝑧 are the
magnetic moment generated by the magnetorquer along the x, y, and z body axis respectively. Also, let the
geomagnetic field be 𝑏 = [𝑏𝑥 𝑏𝑦 𝑏𝑧] where 𝑏𝑥, 𝑏𝑦, and 𝑏𝑧 are the component of the geomagnetic field along
the x, y, and z body axis of the satellite respectively. If you recall, your high school days, 𝜏, 𝑚, and 𝑏 are related
as 𝜏 = 𝑚 × 𝑏 where × is the cross product operator. 𝜏 = 𝑚 × 𝑏 can be equivalently written as

		[𝜏𝑥 𝜏𝑦 𝜏𝑧] = [0 𝑏𝑧 −𝑏x  [mx
				−𝑏𝑧 0 𝑏𝑥  my	
				𝑏𝑦 −𝑏𝑥 0]  mz]

he magnetic moment of a magnetorquer is directly proportional to the current flowing through it. Since,
the maximum current will have an upper bound, hence the maximum magnetic moment of the magnetorquer
will have an upper bound. Let this upper bound be 𝑀. In other words, 𝑚𝑥, 𝑚𝑦, and 𝑚𝑧 are bounded as follows,
−𝑀 ≤ 𝑚𝑥 ≤ 𝑀
−𝑀 ≤ 𝑚𝑦 ≤ 𝑀
−𝑀 ≤ 𝑚𝑧 ≤ M

the power required by the magnetorquer is proportional to (𝑚𝑥)^2 + (𝑚𝑦)^2+ (𝑚𝑧)^2.
 Write a function in python (using the help of the Gurobi solvers) 


 (Data Generation): Recall the inputs and outputs of the optimization solver 

The inputs and outputs of the ML model is the same as that of the optimization solver. In order to generate a
training sample, we use the following steps:
(a) We can randomly generate inputs 𝜏, 𝑏, and 𝑀.
(b) Use the optimization solver developed in Task 2 for the input generated in step (a).
(c) If the optimization problem is feasible, then save the inputs 𝜏, 𝑏, and 𝑀 generated in step (a) and the
output of the optimization solver, 𝑚, in step (b). If the optimization problem is not feasible, then discard
the input generated in step (a) and return back to step (a) to generate a new input. 
By taking steps (a) to (c) you will generate one training sample. You can repeat these steps to generate as many
training samples that you want. 

Please remember:
(i) If 𝜏 and 𝑏 are not perpendicular, then the optimization problem will always be infeasible. Remember
this while randomly generating 𝜏 and 𝑏.
(ii) As you may know, ML models are highly susceptible to the distribution of the input data. The range
of the input data is an important attribute of its distribution. The following is the range of input data
for Task 3:
• |𝜏𝑖| ≤ 3.5 ∙ 10−5 , 𝑖 ∈ {𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧} where |∙| is the absolute value operator.
• |𝑏𝑖| ≤ 2.5 ∙ 10−5, 𝑖 ∈ {𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧}
• 𝑀 ∈ [0.8,1.2]

INPUT HAS 10 COLUMNS:
First 3 are componets of Torque in x,y,z 
Next 3 are components of B in x,y,z
Next component is the M
Last 3 components represent the Outputs which are the optimal solutions of the problem

Training a machine learning model


Problem Statement:
Use the training data generated in Step 1 to train an ML/DL model. You can use
any ML/DL model that you want. Needles to say, you have to divide the training data into training and validation
set



Idea:
The data we have generated in from the guorobi optimization solvers are in continous and So it would make sense to make a regression model instead of any classifications model. The features Torque and B are not linear to Model such as linear regression etc doesnt work.
Lets try with random Forest as the data consist of very less features and the data is very small at around 5900 records. Random Forest could give good accuracy score.
